	/// The term "source" means a read-only collection, as opposed to a "sink"
	/// which would be a write-only collection. The purpose of ISource is to make
	/// it easier to implement a read-only collection, by lifting the requirement
	/// to write implementations for Add(), Remove(), etc.
	/// <para/>
	/// Originally this interface had a Contains() method, just in case the source 
	/// had some kind of fast lookup logic (e.g. hashtable). However, this is 
	/// not allowed in C# 4 when T is marked as "out" (covariant), so Contains() 
	/// must be an extension method.
