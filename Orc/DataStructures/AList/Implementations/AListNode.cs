    /// <summary>
	/// Base class for tree nodes in a list class derived from 
	/// <see cref="AListBase{K,T}"/>. These nodes basically form an in-memory B+tree, 
	/// not necessarily sorted, but structured like a B+tree. That means there are 
	/// two node types: leaf and inner nodes.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Indexes that are passed to methods such as Index, this[] and RemoveAt are
	/// not range-checked except by assertion. The caller (AList or BList) is 
	/// expected to ensure indexes are valid.
	/// <para/>
	/// At the root node level, indexes have the same meaning as they do in 
	/// AListBase itself. However, below the root node, each node has a "base 
	/// index" that is subtracted from any index passed to the node. For example, 
	/// if the root node has two leaf children, and the left one has 20 items, then 
	/// the right child's base index is 20. When accessing item 23, the subindex 3 
	/// is passed to the right child. Note that the right child is not aware of its 
	/// own base index (the parent node manages the base index); as far as each 
	/// node is concerned, it manages a collection of items numbered 0 to 
	/// TotalCount-1.
	/// <para/>
	/// Indexes are expressed with a uint so that nodes are capable of holding up 
	/// to uint.MaxValue-1 elements. AList itself doesn't support sizes over 
	/// int.MaxValue, since it assumes indexes are signed (some protected methods
	/// in AList take unsigned indexes, however). It should be possible to support 
	/// oversize lists in 64-bit machines by writing a derived class based on 
	/// "uint" or "long" indexes; 32-bit processes, however, don't have enough 
	/// address space to even hold int.MaxValue bytes.
	/// <para/>
	/// Before calling any method that modifies a node, it is necessary to call
	/// AutoClone() to check if the node is frozen and clone it if necessary.
	/// TakeFromRight and TakeFromLeft can be called when one or both nodes are 
	/// frozen, but will have no effect.
