    /// <summary>A read-only list indexed by an integer.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The .NET collection classes have a very simple and coarse interface.
	/// <para/>
	/// Member list:
	/// <code>
	/// public T this[int index] { get; }
	/// public T TryGet(int index, ref bool fail);
	/// public Iterator&lt;T> GetIterator();
	/// public int Count { get; }
	/// public IEnumerator&lt;T> GetEnumerator();
	/// System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator();
	/// </code>
	/// The term "source" means a read-only collection, as opposed to a "sink" which
	/// is a write-only collection. The purpose of IListSource is to make it easier
	/// to implement a read-only list, by lifting IList's requirement to write 
	/// implementations for Add(), Remove(), etc. A secondary purpose is, of course,
	/// to guarantee users don't mistakenly call those methods on a read-only
	/// collection.
	/// <para/>
	/// I have often wanted to access the "next" or "previous" item in a list, e.g.
	/// during parsing, but it inconvenient if you have to worry about whether the 
	/// the current item is the first or last. In that case you must check whether
	/// the array index is valid, which is both inconvenient and wasteful, because
	/// the list class will check the array index again, and then the .NET runtime
	/// will check the index a third time when reading the internal array. To make
	/// this more efficient, IListSource has a TryGet() method that does not throw
	/// on failure, but returns default(T).
	/// <para/>
	/// As IListSource is supposed to be a simpler alternative to IList, I didn't
	/// want to require implementers to implement more than two indexers. There are
	/// two additional TryGet extension methods, though:
	/// <code>
	///     bool TryGet(int index, ref T value);
	///     T TryGet(int, T defaultValue);
	/// </code>
	/// If T is defined as "out" (covariant) in C# 4, these methods are not allowed 
	/// in IListSource anyway and MUST be extension methods.
	/// <para/>
	/// Note that "value" is a "ref" rather than an "out" parameter, unlike
	/// Microsoft's own TryGetValue() implementations. Using ref parameter allows
	/// the caller to choose his own default value in case TryGet() returns false.
	/// <para/>
	/// Using <see cref="ListSourceBase{T}"/> as your base class can help you
	/// implement this interface faster.
	/// </remarks>
