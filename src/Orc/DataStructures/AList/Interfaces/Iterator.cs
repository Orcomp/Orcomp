	/// <summary>A high-performance alternative to IEnumerator(of T).</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The normal IEnumerator interface is inefficient, in that one must call two
	/// interface methods on every iteration: MoveNext and Current. This is one of
	/// many small decisions that makes the .NET framework slightly slower than
	/// necessary, but we can work around it by defining this alternative.
	/// <para/>
	/// An enumerator e can be converted to an iterator using
	/// Iterator.ToIterator(e), and an enumerable to IIterable using
	/// Iterator.ToIterable(e). Likewise an iterator i can be converted to an
	/// enumerator using Iterator.ToEnumerator(i), and an iterable to enumerable
	/// using Iterator.ToEnumerable(i).
	/// <para/>
	/// Whether Iterator should be a delegate or interface is hard to decide, as
	/// each has advantages and disadvantages. A delegate call is slightly faster
	/// than an interface call, but sometimes an interface call can be avoided.
	/// Consider List(T).GetEnumerator, which does not return IEnumerator but
	/// rather List(T).Enumerator. Thus, when List(T) is directly used in a 
	/// foreach loop, no interface calls are necessary to call MoveNext() and
	/// Current. Also, an interface allows casting (if the object implements other
	/// interfaces), and the Reset() method. On the other hand, as a delegate,
	/// an Iterator would be easier to define in standard C#--a function can 
	/// return a lambda that implements the iterator.
	/// <para/>
	/// Originally this delegate was defined as bool Iterator(out T current),
	/// so that calling it was like calling MoveNext() except that you get the next
	/// value at the same time. Unfortunately, the CLR does not permit this 
	/// definition to be covariant: only return values can be covariant. Therefore 
	/// I had to change the argument into a return value. However, an extension
	/// method called MoveNext() allows you to call Iterator in the original way:
	/// <code>
	/// T current;
	/// for (Iterator&lt;T> it = list.GetIterator(); it.MoveNext(out current); )
	/// {
	///     ...
	/// }
	/// </code>
	/// Unfortunately, benchmarking shows that MoveNext() adds some overhead, which
	/// eliminates most of the speed advantage that Iterator has over IEnumerator.
	/// </remarks>
